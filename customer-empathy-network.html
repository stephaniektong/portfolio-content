            <h1>Customer Empathy Network</h1>

            <h3>Client Problem Statement</h3>

                <p>In Fall 2021, an e-commerce furniture company engaged the JSR Collective 
                    (a team from the University of Michigan - School of Information) to help them seek 
                    to understand the customer experience in order to make decisions with a customer-centric perspective. 
                    The company had noticed that there is sometimes a disconnect between their customers&apos; 
                    pain points and desires and the decisions made by the company that directly affect those customers. 

                    This “Empathy Network” as designed by the JSR Collective will be used by 
                    existing and future employees to understand the customer journey. 
                    
                    Through analysis of qualitative data sources, this report seeks to interpret the company&apos;s 
                    existing sentiments toward Customer Experience, as well as validate accuracy of those assumptions toward the customer journey.</p>

            <h3>Research Goals</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand the company’s current sentiments toward Customer Experience</li>
                        <li>Validate assumptions made by the company’s leadership toward the customer journey</li>
                        <li>Provide recommendations to support the embedding of a culture of customer-centricity in current and future employees.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p>The team conducted a 6 week virtual study to synthesize internal employee and external customer 
                    feedback toward customer experience. 
                    Employee participants were dispersed across the continental US. 
                    Customer participants were located in key markets for the company.</p>
                    
                        <h4>Phase 1 | x8 1:1 employee interviews across 4 job roles </h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Customer Experience</li>

                            </ul>
                        <h4>Phase 3 | Other artifact synthesis </h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>x2 video recordings of Product-led customer interviews (website usability testing)</li>

                            </ul>
            <h3>My role</h3>
                            <p>Within the JSR Collective (5 teammates), I played the role of project manager and lead researcher. 
                                Direct responsibilities included&colon;

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Acting as lead interviewer for Marketing, Operations, and Customer interviewees.</li>
                                    <li>Ownership of project team management, meeting organization, and client status updates.</li>
                                    <li>Coaching other teammates on client communication and presentation.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>

            <h2> Research</h2>

            <h3>Recruiting</h3>
                <p>Employee interviewees were chosen by the client contact for the project.

                    x1 customer interviewee was provided by the client&apos;s Customer Experience team. 
                    The other x3 interviewees were recruited by the JSR Collective through a survey posted on social networks. 
                    
                    x5 interview protocols were developed by the team for the employee job roles and customers. 
                    Each interview was lead by x1 interviewer accompanied by x1 notetaker. 
                    
                    All interviews were conducted over Zoom.</p>

            <h3>Affinity map</h3>
                <p>Using Miro, the team transcribed the interview notes 
                    into virtual sticky notes used to develop an affinity wall with 3 levels of thematic hierarchy.

            <h3>Customer journey map validation</h3>
                <p>During employee interviews, an artifact was surfaced showing a rough draft of the company&apos;s customer journey. 
                    This was developed as part of a Leadership Team strategy meeting. 

                    The team validated accuracy of the company&apos;s assumptions against affinity wall insights. 
                    The team also provided a revised journey map, including mapping of job roles against customer journey phases 
                    and recommendations for future focus.</p>

            <h3>Background research</h3>
                <p>In order to better serve our client, all 5 members of the JSR Collective also embarked on 
                    individual background research around the problem space of customer experience and 
                    cross-functional collaboration. Altogether, the team reviewed existing literature and produced 20000+ words of relevant reporting.

                    You can read my background research report here: <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nwzufkvZsRRvYSpoNCe_WtrHTOCgezfU-ZDyMyA5S5E/edit?usp=sharing">
                        Defining the customer experience and operational implications for customer-centric firms</a></p>
            
            <h2>Key Findings</h2>

            <h3>Customer experience definition</h3>
                <p>The company&apos;s definition of customer experience is the intersection of good product design and seamless delivery fulfillment. 
                    These two mindsets can sometimes feel at odds with each other, causing a cultural clash between teams.</p>
                    <img src="images/customer_empathy_two_schools.png" alt="Image of a Venn Diagram with text" width="200"/>

                <p>“Customers care the most about whether their problems are being solved or not … we are an e-commerce company selling a product so we have to be solving a problem for them with our product and our solution … this can be different for each customer.”
                    — Employee quote on furniture product design</p>
                
                <p>“Whenever you&apos;re giving someone your hard earned money, I think that is when the most vulnerable, the most emotional the customer is… that&apos;s when they reach out to us, that&apos;s when they&apos;re the most confused or most frustrated or most excited … that&apos;s when they&apos;re feeling all the feelings.”
                        — Employee quote on furniture fulfillment</p>

            <h3>Current sentiments toward the customer</h3>
                <p>Despite the client&apos;s assumption that the company is making decisions 
                    without considering the customer experience, most of the company is experiencing a cultural change 
                    that pushes for customer-centric thinking. The catalyst to this shift was a series of failures during a 
                    recent product launch, resulting in bad press and requiring systemic company triage. 

                    The company&apos;s employees define taking a customer-centric stance as moving away 
                    from reactive customer problem-solving, building out the Customer Experience Team, 
                    and making customer data-driven decisions.

                    However, the Leadership Team caveats that there must be a balance between 
                    customer input and company vision, as it is the vision that attracts their company base.</p>

                <p>“We&apos;ve gotten to this point, candidly, in our business through good intuition and now we need to get way more scientific in what the customer needs.”
                    — Employee</p>

                    <p>"I can&apos;t rule them out all together … there&apos;s something about [the company] I like, they&apos;re trying … I appreciate the designs and I love that it&apos;s a young company, I love stuff like that. It&apos;s everything I support.”
                        — Customer with a negative purchasing experience</p>

            <h3>Customer journey map</h3>
            <img src="images/customer_empathy_phases.png" alt="A chart displaying the 6 phases of the Customer Journey" width="200"/>
                    <p>As drafted by the leadership team, the existing customer journey map is generally accurate 
                        to real customer desires. Based on the customer insights from our analysis, 
                        we recommended emphasizing the following components:

                        <ul>
                            <li>More AR visualization to allow customers to envision furniture products in their own home (in lieu of physically seeing the product before purchase)</li>
                            <li>Increase the customer&apos;s ability to access to Customer Support Team during Research and Purchases phases (currently mostly supporting Delivery and Returns)</li>
                            <li>Update the post-delivery Product Satisfaction Survey to include Delivery Experience feedback</li>
                        </ul>

                        Since the drafted journey map is a recent exercise, employees outside of the Leadership 
                        Team have an ambiguous understanding of what teams work together in the Customer Experience, 
                        including how their own actions influence the customer.</p>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>

            <h3>Customer journey map socialization </h3>

                    <p>Make the customer journey map accessible to the entire team. Through our analysis, 
                        we found that some team members were aware of the customer journey map draft whereas 
                        others were not, leading to disparate views on impactful customer touch points. 

                        It&apos;s recommended to house the customer journey map on a Customer Experience Home Page in the company wiki.</p>

            <h3>Customer experience as a priority</h3>

            <p>Create opportunities to stimulate 
                cross-functional activity / collaboration, mobilize resources, and co-create iterative 
                improvements toward a better customer experience. Following current company norms 
                in product co-creation, this can include “hackathons” where cross-functional 
                teams work together to solve the most common customer support use cases. 

                The company may also consider the inclusion of “customer-centricity” 
                as a core competency for future company recruitment, as all departments are rapidly expanding.</p>

            <h3>Continued customer research</h3>

            <p>Continue to conduct customer research and experiments (using scientific methods). 
                In the last couple months, the E-Commerce team has begun conducting A/B 
                tests on the company&apos;s website using Heap. This has already added value by 
                dispelling previously rooted assumptions on their customer values, such as sustainability 
                being a “nice to have” in furniture decisions, rather than a necessity.

                During these customer research activities, invite other teams / employees 
                to participate as observers. Customer research has been lead by the Product Team; 
                historically, the Product Team has been very protective of their work and invites 
                other teams into the product development process only at specific stages. This has resulted 
                in uneven dissemination across teams of insights gathered during research throughout the product development lifecycle.</p>
