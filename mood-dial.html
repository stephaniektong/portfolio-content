            <h1>Mood Dial</h1>

            <h3>Objective</h3>

            <p>While tech-reliant professionals people may aspire to declutter their life 
                from non-essential distractions such as social media, it&apos;s difficult for busy people 
                to pick up the best practices to stay focused on their priorities&period;

                The goal of this solution is to provide users more self-awareness 
                to their aspirations and everyday routines, resulting in improved mindfulness on 
                what technologies support their goals, wellbeing, and state of mind&period;</p>
            
            <h3>Project scope &plus; deliverable</h3>

            <p>Mood Dial is a solution that blocks technology-driven notifications and distractions while also supports usage reporting and goal setting across multiple devices&period;

                This work was generated as part of a University of Michigan, School of Information course titled <a href = "https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/courses?title=582">SI 582: Introduction to Interaction Design&period;</a> 
                Through active examination and practice of design methods and thinking, the end result is a working mid-fi prototype at course completion&period;</p>

            <h3>My role</h3>

            <p>This was an individual project brought from conception to prototype by me&period</p>

            <h2> Phase 1&colon; Conceptualization and research</h2>

            <h3>Background research</h3>
                <img src="images/mood_dial_maslows.png" alt="A diagram of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs" width="200"/>

                <p> Digital technology is not a basic need&period; Humans are able to operate 
                    physically and safely without access to digital devices or applications&period; 
                    The development of technological assistance bolsters Esteem, whereas technology optimization approaches Self-actualization, allowing people to meet their full potential. 
                    
                    Academic literature around productivity and multitasking shows that 
                    while some people pride themselves in being “good multitasker,” 
                    research shows that there is no good “multitasking.” Additionally, 
                    “flow” may be improved by narrowing attentional focus and stimuli to 
                    one specific subject and exercising control over technology interactions.
                    
                    When examining current world views (causal layered analysis), 
                    there is a growing sentiment among users around fear of technology reliance 
                    and sensory overload, particularly with social media. </p>
            
            <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many competitors that seek to improve productivity by blocking notifications or limiting app usage, 
                    such as Focus Mode. This places more importance toward positioning in order 
                    to differentiate future products from current options. The competitive analysis shows 
                    growth opportunities in the following areas&colon;

                    <ul>
                        <li>Inter-platform connectivity (available for iOS, Android, and everything in between)</li>
                        <li>Goal setting</li>
                        <li>Calendar integrations and other “intelligent” assistance</li>
                    </ul>

                </p>

            <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
            <img src="images/mood_dial_target_audience.png" alt="Mood Dial's target audience" width="200"/>
                <p>
                    5 individual interviews were conducted with participants that met the target audience above.
                    The interviews sought to understand&colon;

                    <ul>
                        <li>User sentiments toward technology</li>
                        <li>How they&apos;re currently managing digital multitasking</li>
                        <li>Initial thoughts on the product concept</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            
            <h3>Synthesis and insights</h3>
            
                <h4>Two types of users</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Those bad at self-moderating device multitasking </li>
                        <li>Focused thinkers (consciously concentrates on one task but sometimes must move 
                            "out of flow" for urgent email/messages)</li>
                    </ul>
    
            <h4>Device Interconnection + Ease of Setup</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>4-9 “smart devices” per household </li>
                    <li>Ease of setup and how they “fit” into their other existing devices are 
                        important considerations when making new technology purchases.</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>General Thoughts on Technology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Technology itself, when leveraged for good, is necessary and powerful.  </li>
                <li>Applications are tools that should be opt-in, not pervasive.</li>
                <li>Social media holds a stigma as anxiety-drawing due to an echo chamber of opinions. </li>
                <li>Technology shouldn't only be about productivity, it should be fun too.</li>
            </ul>

                    <h4>Areas for refinement</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Confusing language made completing tasks for “Create New Usage Profile” and “Add Device” difficult to complete.</li>
                        <li>Preference by users to use Back Button vs bottom navigation bar - low engagement with Home screen</li>
                        <li>The current calendar timeline functionality (click and drag to create event) is not intuitive - should incorporate more traditional type-in / scroll function for Date / Time selection.</li>
                        <li>There were some Figma glitches with the prototype flow - will need to refine before moving to Mid-Fi testing.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <h3>Final design</h3>

            <h2>Future opportunities</h2>

                <h3>Household device management</h3>

                    <p>Similar to Android&apos;s Digital Wellbeing product product, 
                        how might we allow a user to control the technology of 
                        multiple users in order to encourage their household to practice healthy technology usage? </p>
                        
                <h3>Technology access for pure mood-setting</h3>

                    <p>Mood Dial is named this way because it wants to “set the mood.” 
                        How might we decouple mood-setting from goal setting? For instance, 
                        there&apos;s a growing trend in the event planning space where “technology free” 
                        zones are being implemented in order to keep people in the moment. 

                        Can Mood Dial be used to calibrate a “mood” across a large group of people?</p>
